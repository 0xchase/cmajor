## The Cmajor Language

Cmajor is a programming language for writing fast, portable audio software.

You've heard of C, C++, C#, objective-C... well, C*major* is a C-family language designed specifically for writing DSP signal processing code.

#### Project goals

We're aiming to improve on the current status-quo for audio development in quite a few ways:

- To match (and often beat) the performance of traditional C/C++
- To make the same code portable across diverse processor architectures (CPU, DSP, GPU, TPU etc)
- To offer enough power and flexibility to satify professional audio tech industry users
- To speed-up commercial product cycles by enabling sound-designers to be more independent from the instrument platforms
- To attract students and beginners by being vastly easier to learn than C/C++

Our main documentation site is at [cmajor.dev](https://cmajor.dev).

The [Cmajor VScode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SoundStacks.cmajor) offers a one-click install process to get you up-and-running, or see the [Quick Start Guide](https://cmajor.dev/docs/GettingStarted) for other options, like how to use the command-line tools.

If you want to learn about the nitty-gritty of the Cmajor language, the [language guide](https://cmajor.dev/docs/LanguageReference) offers a deep dive. To see some examples of the code, try the [examples](./examples/patches) folder.
